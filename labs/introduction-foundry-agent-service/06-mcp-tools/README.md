# 06. Integrate MCP tools

**Estimated time:** 30 minutes

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This module builds on [Module 04 - Create and chat with a Prompt Agent](../04-prompt-based-agents/README.md) and
> [Module 05 - Agent tools and evaluations](../05-agent-tools-and-evaluations/README.md). Complete both modules before
> starting here. The `acl-remedy-advisor` agent must exist in your Foundry project with Web search and Code Interpreter
> tools already attached.

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD028 -->
> [!NOTE]
> If you could not complete Module 05, run the solution script to create the required agent before continuing:

## Objectives

- Connect the shared **Retail Remedy Operations** MCP server to the `acl-remedy-advisor` agent in Agent Builder.
- Update the agent instructions to guide when to call the MCP tools.
- Test the agent end-to-end with a realistic retail scenario.
- *(Optional)* Run your own copy of the MCP server locally and expose it with a dev tunnel.

## Concepts

### What you are building

The following diagram shows the architecture you will build in this lab.

![Architecture diagram: Python Client calls the acl-remedy-advisor Agent Definition inside a Foundry Project inside a Foundry Account. The Agent Definition calls the chat Model Deployment and may invoke the Web Search Tool (which calls the Internet), the Code Interpreter Tool (sandboxed Python), or the MCP Tool - which connects over HTTPS to a Retail Remedy Operations MCP Server. The MCP Server runs either as a shared Azure Container Apps service (default) or on the local dev machine exposed via a DevTunnel.](../../../docs/assets/diagrams/lab-06-mcp-tools-architecture.svg)

This lab adds a **third** tool to `acl-remedy-advisor`. Unlike Web Search and Code Interpreter - which are built-in tools that run inside the **Foundry Account** - the MCP Tool is a connection to a **Retail Remedy Operations MCP Server** that runs outside the Foundry Account. By default your organizer deploys this server as a shared **Azure Container Apps** service, and the agent calls its six tools over the server's public HTTPS URL (`RETAIL_REMEDY_OPS_MCP_SERVER_URL`). You can also run your own copy locally and expose it with a dev tunnel (`shared/mcp-servers/retail-remedy-ops/src/server.py`). During a turn the agent may combine all three tools: MCP for purchase, policy, and stock facts; Web Search for current ACCC guidance; and Code Interpreter for the pro-rata refund calculation.

### What is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that lets AI agents call external tools over HTTP. Each MCP server exposes a set of typed functions. When the agent's reasoning loop decides it needs information, it calls the appropriate MCP tool, receives a structured response, and incorporates that response into its answer.

### Why does the agent need a public URL?

The `acl-remedy-advisor` agent runs its reasoning loop in the **Azure cloud**. It cannot reach `localhost` or a port on your laptop, so the MCP server must be reachable at a **public HTTPS URL**. The shared Azure Container Apps server your organizer deploys already has one. If you run your own server locally instead, you expose it through a public tunnel - VS Code Dev Tunnels or Codespaces port forwarding both work.

### The Retail Remedy Operations tools

This module uses a mocked server (`shared/mcp-servers/retail-remedy-ops/src/server.py`) that returns deterministic data from a local JSON file. The six tools are:

| Tool | What it returns |
|---|---|
| `lookup_purchase` | Purchase record for a receipt ID |
| `get_product_profile` | Category, expected lifespan, warranty period, repairability |
| `search_store_policy` | Policy excerpts matching a topic keyword |
| `find_replacement_options` | In-stock comparable products with price deltas |
| `draft_remedy_summary` | Structured staff-facing remedy summary (no persistence) |
| `create_remedy_case` | Simulated case creation returning a deterministic case ID |

The tools return **facts, not verdicts**. The agent combines MCP facts with Web search (ACCC guidance) and Code Interpreter (pro-rata calculations) to produce its final guidance.

## Steps

### Part 1 - Connect to the shared MCP server

By default your organizer deploys a shared **Retail Remedy Operations** MCP server to **Azure Container Apps**, and its
public HTTPS URL is already in your onboarding file as `RETAIL_REMEDY_OPS_MCP_SERVER_URL`. You do not need to run anything locally.

#### 1. Confirm your MCP server URL

- [ ] Open your `.env` file and confirm `RETAIL_REMEDY_OPS_MCP_SERVER_URL` is set to the shared URL your organizer provided. It ends in
      `/mcp`, for example:

  ```text
  https://ca-mcp-<env>.<region>.azurecontainerapps.io/mcp
  ```

- [ ] *(Optional)* Confirm the URL is reachable - open it in a browser or run `curl <your RETAIL_REMEDY_OPS_MCP_SERVER_URL>`. A healthy
      server responds with something like `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"server-error","error":{"code":-32600,"message":"Not Acceptable: Client must accept text/event-stream"}}` rather than failing to connect.
- [ ] Keep this URL handy. You paste it into Agent Builder in the next part.

> [!TIP]
> If you want to explore the MCP server in more detail, you can use the [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) tool.

<details>
<summary>Alternative approach - run your own MCP server locally and expose it with a devtunnel.</summary>

This approach is only recommended if you or your organizer did not deploy the shared MCP servers,
or you want to run and modify the server yourself, host it locally and expose it with a public HTTPS tunnel.
The Azure-hosted agent runs in the cloud and cannot reach `localhost`, so a devtunnel is used to expose it,
and the port must be **Public**.

This approach is useful when you want to run your MCP server locally so that you can debug it, modify its behavior,
or inspect its logs. The shared server is read-only and cannot be modified.

1. Start the server from the repository root (or run the **mcp: run retail-remedy-ops server** task):

   ```bash
   uv run python shared/mcp-servers/retail-remedy-ops/src/server.py
   ```

   Confirm it prints `Starting Retail Remedy Operations MCP server on http://0.0.0.0:8080/mcp`.

1. In the VS Code **PORTS** panel, forward port `8080`, then right-click the row and set **Port Visibility** →
   **Public**. In a devcontainer or Codespace the default is **Private**, so this step is mandatory - a private port
   returns a 403 when the Azure-hosted agent calls it.

1. Copy the forwarded address, append `/mcp`, and set `RETAIL_REMEDY_OPS_MCP_SERVER_URL` in your `.env` to the full URL. Keep the server
   running and the port **Public** for the rest of the workshop.

| Environment | Tunnel mechanism | URL style |
|---|---|---|
| Local VS Code or a devcontainer | [VS Code Dev Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/port-forwarding) | `https://<id>-8080.<region>.devtunnels.ms` |
| GitHub Codespaces | [Codespaces port forwarding](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/forwarding-ports-in-your-codespace) | `https://<codespace-name>-8080.app.github.dev` |

The first time you forward a port from local VS Code, VS Code prompts you to sign in to the **Dev Tunnels** service with
your GitHub or Microsoft account. Some networks block the cloud-hosted agent from reaching a `devtunnels.ms` tunnel even
when the port is Public; if tool calls fail intermittently, use the shared Azure Container Apps server instead.

### Part 2 - Connect the MCP server to the agent

> [!NOTE]
> The following steps use the **Foundry Toolkit** extension in VS Code. But you can also use the Foundry portal, but the screenshots and instructions below are for the VS Code extension. For extra credit you could try using the portal instead of VS Code to add the MCP tool and update the agent instructions.

#### 2. Open the agent in Agent Builder

- [ ] Make sure **VS Code Insiders** is open with the **Foundry Toolkit** extension loaded. Click the **Foundry Toolkit** icon in the Activity Bar to show the **My Resources** panel.
- [ ] In the **My Resources** panel, select **Prompt Agents** and then open the `acl-remedy-advisor` agent.
- [ ] Confirm the Agent Builder header shows `acl-remedy-advisor`.

  </details>

  > You can also view your agents in the [Microsoft Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com) under **Build → Agents**.

  </details>

#### 3. Add the MCP tool

- [ ] Scroll to the **TOOL** section and click the **+** button.
- [ ] In the tool picker, select the **Custom** tab and select the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.

  <details>
  <summary>📸 Screenshot: Select a Tool</summary>

  ![Foundry Toolkit Agent select a tool panel showing Model Context Protocol (MCP)](../../../docs/assets/screenshots/introduction-foundry-agent-service/lab-06/01c-toolkit-agent-select-a-tool.png)

  </details>

- [ ] Fill in the connection details:

  | Field | Value |
  |---|---|
  | Label / Name | `retail-remedy-ops` |
  | Server URL | Your `RETAIL_REMEDY_OPS_MCP_SERVER_URL`, ending in `/mcp` |
  | Authentication | None / Anonymous |

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > In a production environment we would not deploy MCP servers without authentication. This lab uses a shared publically server for convenience, so the agent can call it anonymously. You should not leave this running permanently.

  <!-- -->

  > [!NOTE]
  > **Naming difference between the portal and the solution script.** The portal connection name only allows letters, numbers, **dashes**, and dots - so you enter `retail-remedy-ops` (with dashes). The Python solution script (`solution/create_agent_with_mcp.py`) uses the Azure AI Agents SDK, whose `server_label` only allows letters, numbers, and **underscores** - so it uses `retail_remedy_ops` (with underscores). The two values intentionally differ because each platform enforces a different naming rule; both refer to the same MCP server.

  </details>

- [ ] Confirm and save.
- [ ] In the **Select a tool** dialog, confirm that the `retail-remedy-ops` tool is now displayed and selected and click **Add Tools (1)**.
- [ ] Verify that the new tool now appears in the **TOOLS** box in the Agent Builder.

  After saving, the Foundry portal Playground view shows all three tools - Code Interpreter, Web Search, and the MCP server - connected to the agent:

  </details>

> [!TIP]
> **Code fallback:** If the Agent Builder UI cannot add the MCP tool, run the code fallback script which creates a new agent version directly via the API:
>
> ```bash
> uv run python labs/introduction-foundry-agent-service/06-mcp-tools/solution/create_agent_with_mcp.py
> ```
>
> Ensure `RETAIL_REMEDY_OPS_MCP_SERVER_URL` is set in your `.env` file before running the script.

### Part 3 - Update the agent instructions

The agent needs guidance on when to call the MCP tools. Without it the model may answer from general knowledge instead of calling the tools.

#### 4. Add the MCP tool-boundary instruction

- [ ] Scroll to the **Instructions** field in Agent Builder.
- [ ] Position your cursor at the very end of the existing instructions.
- [ ] Press **Enter** twice to create a blank line, then add the following paragraph:

  ```text
  Use the retail operations MCP tools when a question includes a receipt ID,
  customer ID, or product ID, or when staff ask about store policy, warranty
  details, or replacement availability. Call lookup_purchase first to retrieve
  the purchase record, then get_product_profile for lifespan and warranty data,
  search_store_policy for relevant policy excerpts, and find_replacement_options
  if the customer may want a replacement. Use draft_remedy_summary to produce a
  structured summary for the staff member. Use create_remedy_case to log the
  outcome if the staff member confirms the remedy. Do not invent purchase,
  warranty, policy, or stock details - call the MCP tools instead.
  ```

#### 5. Save the new version

- [ ] Click **Save to Foundry** in Agent Builder.
- [ ] Confirm Agent Builder saves a **new version** of the agent. Saving any change - including adding the MCP tool - creates a new version. The exact number depends on how many times the agent has been saved before; for example, an agent created by the Module 05 solution script starts at **Version 1**, so this save produces **Version 2**.

### Part 4 - Test with a realistic scenario

#### 6. Run the battery-failure test prompt

- [ ] The Agent Builder should already be open showing the playground for `acl-remedy-advisor`. but if it isn't open the Agent in the Foundry Toolkit.
- [ ] Paste the following prompt and send it:

  ```text
  Receipt R-1007 is for a laptop bought by customer C-1042. The battery now only
  holds 20% charge after 14 months of normal use. Check our records and store
  policy, then advise the retail staff member what remedy to offer under Australian
  Consumer Law. Include any replacement options and calculate a reasonable
  pro-rata refund.
  ```

  <details>

  ![Foundry Toolkit agent playground with the battery-failure prompt ready to send](../../../docs/assets/screenshots/introduction-foundry-agent-service/lab-06/03-toolkit-playground-prompt.png)

  </details>

- [ ] Watch the agent run. Confirm the agent calls the MCP tools in sequence before producing its answer.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If the portal playground returns a `missing_required_parameter: tools[1].container` error, this means the Code Interpreter tool needs to be re-added through the Agent Builder UI (the code fallback script does not configure the container automatically). Use `starter.py` from the terminal to test instead, or remove and re-add Code Interpreter through Agent Builder.

#### 7. Approve any MCP tool calls

Depending on how you added the MCP tool to the agent (via the Foundry Toolkit or through the Foundry Portal) the default approval behavior may differ. If you wish to configure the default tool approval behavior, select the **...** to the right of the MCP tool and select **Configure**.

- Foundry Toolkit currently defaults to **Always approve all tools**, so you may not see any prompts. If you do see an **Approve / Deny** prompt, follow the steps below to approve the tool calls. The first time the agent calls an MCP tool, the playground pauses and shows an **Approve / Deny** prompt. This is the MCP human-in-the-loop approval gate - the agent will not call the tool until you approve it.

  <details>
  <summary>📸 Screenshot: Foundry Toolkit agent MCP tool configuration approvals</summary>

  ![Foundry Toolkit agent agent MCP tool configuring approvals](../../../docs/assets/screenshots/introduction-foundry-agent-service/lab-06/04a-toolkit-agent-configure-tool-call-approvals.png)

  </details>

- Foundry Portal currently defaults to **Never auto-approve tools**, so you will see a prompt for each new tool the agent calls. You can change this to **Always auto-approve tools** to avoid repeated prompts. You can also filter the list of tools that can be used by the agent with **Allowed retail-rememdy-ops tool** - which is not something that can currently be done in the Foundry Toolkit.

  <details>

  ![Foundry Portal agent agent MCP tool configuring approvals](../../../docs/assets/screenshots/introduction-foundry-agent-service/lab-06/04b-portal-agent-configure-tool-call-approvals.png)

  </details>

- [ ] When the **Approve / Deny** prompt appears, click the **Approve** button.

  > [!NOTE]
  > In the Foundry Portal experience you can also drop the **Approve** button down and select **Approve once** (approve this single call) and **Always approve this tool** (auto-approve future calls to this one tool) and **Always approve all tools**. Until you save the agent with the approval preference applied, the playground may still prompt once per new tool the agent calls.

  </details>

#### 8. Inspect the conversation

- [ ] In the playground, confirm the agent produces a final response that includes a remedy recommendation citing store policy and ACL, and a pro-rata refund calculation.
- [ ] Confirm MCP tool calls appear in the trace (e.g., `lookup_purchase`, `get_product_profile`, `search_store_policy`).
- [ ] Confirm Code Interpreter is called to calculate the pro-rata refund.
- [ ] Confirm the final response includes a clear remedy recommendation citing store policy and ACL.

  </details>

### Part 5 (extra credit) - Browse the run trace in the Foundry portal

The **Traces** tab in the Foundry portal shows each agent conversation as a structured trace when Application Insights is connected to your Foundry project. This lets you inspect the exact sequence of MCP tool calls, model reasoning steps, and Code Interpreter invocations.

> [!NOTE]
> The traces are also available in the **Conversations** tab of the Foundry Toolkit playground, but the currently the Foundry portal shows a richer view of the trace timeline, including the ability to "replay" the timeline and series of calls.

#### 9. Open the agent in the Foundry portal

- [ ] In a browser, navigate to [Microsoft Foundry](https://ai.azure.com) and sign in.
- [ ] In the left navigation, click **Build** → **Agents**.
- [ ] Click **acl-remedy-advisor** to open the agent.

  <details>

  ![Foundry portal Agents list showing acl-remedy-advisor](../../../docs/assets/screenshots/introduction-foundry-agent-service/lab-06/01b-portal-agents-list.png)

  </details>

#### 10. Open the Traces tab

- [ ] In the agent view, click the **Traces** tab.

  <details>
  <summary>📸 Screenshot: Traces tab for acl-remedy-advisor</summary>

  ![Traces tab for acl-remedy-advisor - shows Conversations and Responses sub-tabs](../../../docs/assets/screenshots/introduction-foundry-agent-service/lab-06/08a-portal-agent-traces.png)

  </details>

  > [!NOTE]
  > Trace data requires **Application Insights** to be connected to your Foundry project. If the Traces tab shows a "Connect" banner, click it to link an Application Insights resource. Once connected, future conversations will appear as traces automatically.

#### 11. Inspect the MCP tool call flow

- [ ] Under the **Conversations** sub-tab, click any **Conversation Id** to open it.

  <details>
  <summary>📸 Screenshot: Conversation trace for acl-remedy-advisor</summary>

  ![Conversation trace for acl-remedy-advisor - shows the complete trace of the conversation](../../../docs/assets/screenshots/introduction-foundry-agent-service/lab-06/09b-portal-agent-conversation.png)

  </details>

- [ ] In the trace timeline, locate the MCP tool call steps - they appear as `mcp_call` entries labelled with the tool name (e.g., `lookup_purchase`, `get_product_profile`).
- [ ] Confirm the calls appear in the expected sequence: purchase lookup → product profile → store policy → replacement options → reasoning → Code Interpreter (pro-rata) → summary.
- [ ] Click any individual tool call to view the exact input payload and returned JSON.

---

### Part 6 (optional) - Verify from code

#### 12. Chat from the terminal

- [ ] In a new terminal, start the chat client:

  ```bash
  uv run python labs/introduction-foundry-agent-service/06-mcp-tools/src/invoke-agent.py
  ```

- [ ] Send the same battery-failure prompt.

  ```text
  Receipt R-1007 is for a laptop bought by customer C-1042. The battery now only
  holds 20% charge after 14 months of normal use. Check our records and store
  policy, then advise the retail staff member what remedy to offer under Australian
  Consumer Law. Include any replacement options and calculate a reasonable
  pro-rata refund.
  ```

- [ ] Confirm `[tool: ...]` indicators appear before the final response, showing the agent called tools during the turn.

---

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The agent reuses these MCP tools in later modules** (Module 09 - Hosted Agents and Module 10 - Foundry Toolboxes). The shared MCP server stays available, so you do not need to do anything to keep it running. If you are running your own local server instead, leave it running with port 8080 set to **Public**, and keep `RETAIL_REMEDY_OPS_MCP_SERVER_URL` pointed at it.

---

## Validation

- The `acl-remedy-advisor` agent lists six MCP tools in its tool configuration.
- The battery-failure test prompt triggers at least three MCP tool calls visible in the run trace.
- The run trace also shows Code Interpreter used for the pro-rata calculation.
- The final response includes a remedy recommendation, a refund or replacement option, and a policy citation.
- If you run your own local MCP server, its terminal shows incoming request logs during the agent run.

## Congratulations 🎉

You connected your agent to live, custom operations. You wired the `retail_remedy_ops` MCP server's tools into `acl-remedy-advisor` over its public URL - then watched the agent orchestrate MCP calls, Code Interpreter, and reasoning together to resolve a real battery-failure scenario end to end. Your agent can now act on domain-specific data, not just answer from general knowledge.

> [!TIP]
> **Next up → [Module 07: Ground the agent with Foundry IQ knowledge bases](../07-foundry-iq/README.md)**
> Ground your agent in trusted knowledge so its answers cite your own indexed sources. No need to scroll - jump straight in!

## Troubleshooting

- **Tools not discovered:** Confirm the MCP server is running (`http://localhost:8080/mcp` should respond) and the tunnel URL ends in `/mcp`. Restart the server if it stopped.
- **Port not reachable (403 or connection refused):** Confirm the port visibility is set to **Public** in the PORTS panel. Private ports return 403 to the Azure-hosted agent.
- **Tools are never called:** Strengthen the agent instructions - add the MCP tool-boundary paragraph from Part 4 and re-save as a new version. Use a prompt that explicitly includes a receipt ID.
- **Tool call times out:** The Agent Service times out MCP calls at 100 seconds. If the server is unresponsive, restart it and verify the tunnel is still active.
- **Tunnel URL changed:** If you recreated the tunnel, the URL changes. Update `RETAIL_REMEDY_OPS_MCP_SERVER_URL` in `.env`, edit the MCP tool connection in Agent Builder with the new URL, and re-save the agent.
- **`MCPTool` import fails in the code fallback:** Confirm `azure-ai-projects>=2.0.0` is installed (run `uv sync` from the repo root).
- **Portal playground returns `missing_required_parameter: tools[1].container`:** The code fallback script (`create_agent_with_mcp.py`) creates Code Interpreter without the container reference the portal requires. To fix: in Agent Builder, click the `⋮` menu next to Code Interpreter, remove it, then click **Add** → **Code Interpreter** to re-add it through the UI. Alternatively, test using `invoke-agent.py` from the terminal, which does not require the container reference.
