# Introduction to Foundry Agent Service

This Lab covers the full end-to-end journey for building and shipping agentic solutions with Microsoft Foundry.

In this Lab, you will learn how to:

1. Set up your workshop environment and verify access.
1. Build prompt-based and hosted agents.
1. Orchestrate tools and multi-agent patterns.
1. Apply Agent Framework patterns in Python.
1. Use Foundry IQ and Toolboxes for richer agent workflows.
1. Prepare agent identity and publishing workflows.

The module pages are generated automatically during docs build and preview from source README files in the lab directories under `labs/introduction-foundry-agent-service`.

## Scenario

Throughout the lab, you will build a single production-grade agent called `acl-remedy-advisor` - an Australian Consumer Law (ACL) Remedy Advisor designed to help retail staff determine the correct remedy when a customer reports a product problem. Starting with a simple prompt-based agent in Microsoft Foundry Agent Builder, the agent is incrementally enriched across twelve modules: web search and Code Interpreter tools are added for live ACCC guidance and pro-rata refund calculations; a custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) server called `retail-remedy-ops` is wired in to look up real purchase records, product profiles, store policies, and replacement stock; a Foundry IQ knowledge base grounds the agent in the retailer's own policy documents; the agent is driven programmatically via the Python Agent Framework; and finally it is packaged as a containerised hosted agent and consumed through a Foundry Toolbox - all the way through to agent identity, operational monitoring, and publishing.

| 11 | [Agent Ops and Agent ID](./11-agent-ops-and-agent-id/README.md) | 30 min | ✅ | Agent identity and operational monitoring configured. |
| 12 | [Publishing Agents](./12-publishing-agents/README.md) | 25 min | ✅ | `acl-remedy-advisor` published to Microsoft 365 Copilot and Teams and verified in a live conversation. |

Total time: ~3-4 hours, depending on how many modules you complete and your familiarity with the concepts. Each module builds on the previous ones, so we recommend following them in order.

However, if you are short on time or want to jump to a specific topic, you can pick and choose modules. Many of the modules include scripts in the `solution` folder that set up the end state of that module, so you can start from there if you don't have time to complete the earlier modules.
